# "Library" source code

This directory is for the source code that you shouldn't have to touch often, if at all.

It is not special in any way; rather, it exists so that `src/` contains your own source code, and isn't cluttered by what gb-starter-kit provides.
Feel free to add more files to this directory if you feel it's relevant, too!

## `rand.inc`

That file is included from `misc.asm`, with a comment explaining why it's `INCLUDE`d instead of being `rand.asm`.
