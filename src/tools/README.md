# Tools

Programs used to help build the ROM should go here.

By default, three tools are provided, written in [Python].

## Why Python?

Python is a good solution to write cross-platform programs without imposing a lot of setup on the end user.

If you prefer writing your custom tools in another programming language, by all means go ahead!

## Why `src/tools/`?

The root directory quickly gets cluttered with lots of files and directories, so it's preferable to move things to sub-directories when possible.
